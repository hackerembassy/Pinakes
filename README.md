## Requirements

- **PHP 8.2 or higher** — matches `composer.json` (`^8.2`); the installer and the in-app updater enforce this floor.
- **MySQL 5.7+** or **MariaDB 10.3+**
- **PHP extensions**: PDO, PDO MySQL, MySQLi, Mbstring, JSON, GD, Fileinfo, Zip
- **Web server**: Apache (`mod_rewrite` + `.htaccess`) or nginx
- No Composer or Node build tools are needed on the production host — frontend assets are precompiled and `vendor/` ships inside the release ZIP.

## What's New in v0.7.19

### Faceted catalog filters ([#169](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/pull/169))

The public catalog (`/catalogo`) filters were reworked to be clear and noise-free. Choosing a value **collapses** that facet to a removable pill and re-scopes the others; options that would return zero results disappear, single-value facets are suppressed, and the year range clamps to the data's real bounds. A new **Author** facet joins genres, publishers, media type and availability, long lists scroll internally with subtle borders, and everything is **theme-aware** (driven by the app's CSS variables).

### Complete backup & restore ([#162](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/162) / [#167](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/pull/167))

A full backup system from **Admin → Updates/Maintenance**: it archives the database **and** the uploaded files, with a hash-verified, streaming restore (fail-loud staging/promotion, 4xx restore errors, admin-only download/delete). Restores replace the database content with the archive's — only restore trusted archives.

### Scanner & cover fixes ([#164](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/164) / [#165](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/165))

The ISBN scanner now commits on **Enter** even when a partial prefix matches an existing entry, and book-cover replacement is a single step (no dead links left when an external cover can't be downloaded).

### Install & operations robustness

- **cPanel install fix:** when the document root is the project root (a very common shared-hosting layout), the installer now self-heals the root `.htaccess` so routing and all assets work even though cPanel's File Manager hides the dotfile during extraction. No manual step required.
- **`/chi-siamo` (and localized CMS pages)** resolve reliably: the CMS page lookup tolerates a row seeded with a different-locale slug.
- **Login rate limit** relaxed from 5 to **15 attempts / 5 min** — far fewer accidental lockouts during setup, still bounded against brute force.

### UI polish

The book page "Cerca su" external-search block moved to its own row (no longer crammed in with the action buttons), genre breadcrumb separators are vertically aligned, and the related-book availability/eBook badges no longer overlap. Bundled plugin **goodlib** bumped to 1.0.1 (ships to new installs and is overwritten on upgrade).

### Testing

A 32-point regression suite covers the scanner/cover and backup/restore work ([#168](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/pull/168)), plus 26 new tests for the install/CMS/rate-limit/UI fixes. The full lifecycle suite (135) is green and the real admin-UI upgrade path (`reinstall-test.sh` Test B) passes; PHPStan level 5 clean. No new migration in this release (schema baseline stays at `migrate_0.7.17.sql`).

---

## What's New in v0.7.18

### Configurable loan & reservation system (#157)

The loan lifecycle is now fully admin-configurable from **Settings → Loans**: default loan duration, maximum active loans per user (`0` = unlimited), maximum renewals, and the pickup window for approved loans. A unified, multi-copy **occupancy model** governs availability — a copy is occupied by an active loan (`in_corso` / `in_ritardo` / `da_ritirare` / `prenotato`) or by a pending request that already holds a copy, while a *bare* pending request (no copy assigned yet) does not block other users until an admin approves it and assigns a copy. Returning a copy automatically reassigns it to the next waiting reservation in the queue, deferred email notifications are flushed only **after** the transaction commits (each send isolated so one failure can't drop the others), and maintenance automations handle pickup expiry and scheduled-reservation conversion. Database changes ship in **`migrate_0.7.17.sql`** (loan settings + reworked overlap triggers, applied through a DELIMITER-aware updater step).

### Private mode — restrict the site to registered users (#158)

A new **Settings → Advanced → Private mode** switch makes the entire public site (home, catalog, book pages) require login. It is **off by default**. When enabled, unauthenticated API calls get a JSON `401`, private uploads are withheld, but public assets (book covers, branding) stay reachable, and the API-key-gated `/api/public/*` routes keep responding through their own `ApiKeyMiddleware` instead of being pre-empted by a session `401`.

### English admin routes (#145)

All `/admin/*` paths are now English literals (`/admin/books`, `/admin/loans`, `/admin/reservations`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/publishers`, `/admin/genres`, …) instead of Italian. Old Italian admin URLs keep working through legacy redirects (`301` for `GET`, `308` for `POST` so form submissions preserve their body and CSRF), so existing bookmarks and integrations don't break. Admin routes are deliberately **not** part of the i18n route system — they are fixed English paths.

### Testing

Validated end to end on the merged `main`: the full lifecycle suite (135 passing), the dedicated loan / reservation / overlap suites (35 + 26 + 21), and a new private-mode suite (10), all green, with PHPStan level 5 clean.

---

## What's New in v0.7.16

### Multi-publisher, hardened end to end (#143)

Books can have more than one publisher (the `libri_editori` junction, introduced in 0.7.15). This release closes every gap in that model: publisher **filters, counts, exports, the public publisher archive, the catalog facet, search, the admin API and bulk operations** now all match a book whether the publisher is its primary one (`libri.editore_id`) or a secondary one in the junction. Merging two publishers re-points the junction onto the survivor **before** the cascade, so no association is lost; the publisher-delete guard counts secondary links too; and CSV / LibraryThing import and bulk-enrichment now keep the junction in sync so interop exporters (OAI-PMH, BIBFRAME) never lose a publisher.

Every new junction query is **guarded for pre-migration installs** — on a database that predates the junction table the queries gracefully fall back to the primary publisher instead of erroring.

### PHP 8.2 is now the floor

The installer and the in-app updater now require **PHP 8.2+**, matching `composer.json` (`^8.2`) and the generated `platform_check.php`. Previously an 8.1 host could pass preflight and then die at the Composer bootstrap.

### Other fixes

- **Multi-character book-case codes** (#153): the legacy single-letter UNIQUE constraint on `scaffali.lettera` is dropped, so codes like `L1`, `L2` no longer collide.
- **Edit form**: the "Import from ISBN" field is pre-filled with the book's ISBN/EAN when editing.
- A reconciliation migration heals any `libri_editori` drift left by imports written before the sync landed.

### Testing

The comprehensive E2E suite grew to **132 tests**, adding a 20-test **Archives** phase (ISAD(G) CRUD, hierarchy, SQL seeding, authority records, and the JSON/XML APIs — RiC-O JSON-LD, IIIF, OAI-PMH, SRU, MARCXML/Dublin Core/EAD3/METS) and a 9-test **multi-publisher / multi-author** phase. Validated with a fresh-install + real-upgrade regression.

## What's New in v0.7.14

### Installer fix: wizard no longer wedges at step 6 (Configurazione Email)

Hot-fix for an install-blocking bug discovered immediately after v0.7.13: every new install on a host **without a TLD** (`localhost`, an IP literal, or any intranet hostname such as `pinakes-vm`) got stuck at step 6 of the install wizard. The default `From Email` was derived from `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` and accepted when the host passed `FILTER_VALIDATE_DOMAIN` — which `localhost` does. The same value was then re-validated at submit time with `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL`, which is stricter (requires a TLD), so `no-reply@localhost` was silently rejected. The form posted, the controller flagged the validation failure, the same page re-rendered, and the install never progressed.

`installer/steps/step6.php` now validates the host the same way `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` will: it only adopts the live `HTTP_HOST` if `no-reply@{host}` itself passes `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL`. Otherwise the default falls back to `example.com` (RFC 2606 reserved, always a syntactically valid placeholder). The user can still override the field manually.

Verified end-to-end with a fresh install from the v0.7.14 ZIP on localhost: the wizard now advances past step 6 with the default value untouched and reaches step 7 (Installazione Completata) cleanly.

No schema migrations. No code changes outside the installer. Existing 0.7.13 installs are unaffected and don't need to re-install.

---

## What's New in v0.7.13

### Performance: HTTP compression + long-term cache for static assets

Apache (`public/.htaccess`) and the nginx example (`.nginx.conf.example`) now ship a `# === Pinakes performance block ===` that turns on gzip/brotli compression and applies `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` to versioned CSS/JS/font assets. Every directive is gated by `<IfModule …>` (Apache) or feature-tested (nginx) so the file stays valid on hosts where the optional modules aren't loaded. Measured locally on the home page: `vendor.bundle.js` 3.5 MB → ~800 KB gzip, `main.css` 192 KB → 30 KB gzip (−84%), HTML home 471 KB → 91 KB (−81%). Asset URLs are already version-busted with `?v=X.Y.Z`, so the 1-year `immutable` lifetime is safe — every release rotates the URL automatically.

For nginx specifically, the `location ^~ /uploads/` block now adds a `Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000` header (cover images, uploaded media) — without this explicit add_header, the prefix-priority of `^~ /uploads/` would short-circuit the regex location that previously set caching for static files, leaving uploads served with no cache headers at all. Apache wasn't affected because `mod_headers` applies `FilesMatch` globally.

Existing installations upgrading via the in-admin updater pick this up through `post-install-patch.php`: an idempotent search/replace injects the same performance block into the live `.htaccess` for every install on `0.4.0`–`0.7.12`. The patch is gated by `<IfModule>` and uses a stable 4-line anchor (`RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]` … `# Security Headers`) verified to exist unchanged from v0.4.9.9 through v0.7.12.

### Bulk "Scarica copertine" self-heals missing covers ([visible bug](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/pull/144))

`LibriController::fetchCover()` and `syncCovers()` used to trust `libri.copertina_url` alone when deciding whether a book already had a cover, returning `reason: already_has_cover` even when the file behind that URL had been deleted on disk (a common state after manual cleanups, partial backup restores, or failed downloads). The bulk "Scarica copertine" action would then report `Completato. Già presenti: 1` and the book stayed permanently uncovered.

Both methods now resolve the path with `realpath()` against `getCoversUploadPath()` and require the resolved file to live inside the covers directory (`str_starts_with($resolved, $baseDir . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR)`) — a defence-in-depth tightening compared to the existing delete path. If the file is missing or unreachable, the controller logs a warning (`cover_url in DB but file missing/unreachable on disk, re-fetching`), re-runs the scrape, downloads a fresh cover, and updates the DB. Idempotent on subsequent calls.

### Minor UI fixes

- `.search-book-year` in the hero search dropdown is now explicitly left-aligned, matching the sibling `.search-book-author` line.
- `.description-content .prose` in the book-detail page gets `max-w-none` so the description fills its column instead of being capped at Tailwind Typography's default 65ch (already constrained by the page grid).

### Notes

- No schema migrations — drop-in upgrade from `v0.7.12`.
- No new bundled plugins, no breaking changes.
- The companion `post-install-patch.php` is attached to the GitHub release and applied automatically by the in-admin updater; nothing for end users to do manually.

## What's New in v0.7.12

### Archives: RiC-CM Phases 5 & 6 — admin UI + OAI-PMH `ric-o` ([#122](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/122))

v0.7.12 closes the six-phase RiC-CM roadmap. Phases 1-4 (shipped progressively in 0.7.7 → 0.7.10) modelled the four RiC-CM entity types (Record/RecordSet, Agent, Activity, Place) and the polymorphic relations graph. Phases 5 and 6 expose them to curators and to harvesters.

**Phase 5 — native admin UI for activities, places and relations.**

- `GET/POST /admin/archives/activities` + `/new` + `/{id}` + `/{id}/edit` + `/{id}/delete` — CRUD over ISDF activities (Function/Activity/Transaction/Task/Mandate). Hierarchical parent/child with cycle detection on the application layer (the `parent_id` FK uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`, which is incompatible with a MySQL `CHECK` constraint, so the cycle guard is enforced in PHP before INSERT/UPDATE).
- `GET/POST /admin/archives/places` + `/new` + `/{id}` + `/{id}/edit` + `/{id}/delete` — CRUD over places (country/region/province/municipality/locality/building/room/geographic_feature/other) with optional latitude/longitude and GeoNames / Wikidata / Getty TGN identifiers for Linked Data linkage.
- `POST /admin/archives/relations/attach` + `POST /admin/archives/relations/{id}/detach` — manage the polymorphic relations graph from the unit/agent/activity/place detail pages.
- `GET /api/archives/entities?type=&q=` — typeahead backend for Choices.js-style autocomplete in the relation forms. Returns the four entity types validated against the ENUM definitions of `archive_relations.source_type` / `target_type`.

The chrome mirrors the existing books/archives admin views (Tailwind `p-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto`, `bg-white shadow rounded-lg p-6 space-y-5` form containers, `form-label` field labels, breadcrumb navigation, indigo-600 primary actions, red-50/red-700 destructive buttons). All 60+ user-facing strings are Italian-source `__()` wrappers with full translations added to `locale/en_US.json`, `locale/fr_FR.json`, `locale/de_DE.json`.

**Phase 6 — OAI-PMH `metadataPrefix=ric-o`.**

- The `oai-pmh-server` plugin now exposes `ric-o` (canonical RDF/XML serialisation of the same RiC-O graph emitted on `/archives/{id}/ric.json`) as a metadataPrefix for the `archives` set. `ListMetadataFormats` advertises it conditionally — only when the `archives` plugin is active AND the `archival_units` table exists.
- `GetRecord?identifier=oai:…:archival_unit:{id}&metadataPrefix=ric-o` serialises one archival unit as `<rdf:RDF>` with `ric:RecordSet` / `ric:Record` root, `rdfs:label` carrying `xml:lang`, `ric:DateRange` with `xsd:gYear` typed literals, embedded `ric:Relation` subjects for agent links, and `rdf:resource` references for parent/children. `ListRecords?set=archives&metadataPrefix=ric-o` streams the whole archival graph.
- Symmetric validation: `metadataPrefix=ric-o` on `set=books` or on a book identifier returns `cannotDisseminateFormat`; `metadataPrefix=oai_dc` keeps working on both sets unchanged.
- Re-uses `RicJsonLdBuilder::serializeToRdfXml()` (new in this release) which translates the JSON-LD compact document to canonical RDF/XML — `@id`→`rdf:about`/`rdf:resource`, `@type`→tag name (CURIE expanded against the document `@context`), language tags via `xml:lang`, typed literals via `rdf:datatype`, nested blank nodes for inline objects. 159/159 unit assertions passing on the round-trip.

The full RiC-CM journey: v0.7.7 read-only JSON-LD → v0.7.8 agents → v0.7.9 activities → v0.7.10 places + polymorphic relations → v0.7.12 admin UI + OAI-PMH RDF/XML. The application's `version.json` bumps from 0.7.10 to 0.7.12 once, at the end of the chain.

**Cleanup — dead schema column dropped (review F015).** The `archive_activities.place_id` column was introduced in 0.7.9 as a placeholder reserved for the Phase 4 `archive_places` FK, but Phase 4 (0.7.10) chose the polymorphic `archive_relations` graph instead and no application code ever read or wrote the column. Migration `migrate_0.7.12.sql` drops it with `ALTER TABLE archive_activities DROP COLUMN place_id;` so the schema reflects what the code actually uses.

---

## What's New in v0.7.10

### Archives: RiC-CM Phase 4 — Places + polymorphic Relations graph ([#122](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/122))

Fourth phase of the RiC-CM roadmap. With Phases 1-3 we modelled three of the five RiC-CM entity types (Record/RecordSet, Agent, Activity). Phase 4 introduces the fourth — **Place** — and the **generic polymorphic Relations** backbone that lets any pair of entities carry a typed RiC-O predicate. The model is now complete on the entity side.

- **New table `archive_places`** — first-class Place entity (RiC-CM §3.5). `name` + `place_type` ENUM (country / region / province / municipality / locality / building / room / geographic_feature / other), self-referential `parent_id` for the place hierarchy (Catania → Sicilia → Italia), optional `latitude` / `longitude` for map display, optional `geonames_id` / `wikidata_id` / `tgn_id` for external Linked Data identifiers, optional `date_start` / `date_end` for historical places (e.g. "Regno delle Due Sicilie", 1816-1861). Full-text index on `name + description`.
- **New table `archive_relations`** — **polymorphic** N:M relations between any two RiC-CM entities. Both endpoints (`source_type`+`source_id` and `target_type`+`target_id`) reference one of four entity types: `archival_unit`, `authority_record`, `archive_activity`, `archive_place`. The `ric_predicate` column is VARCHAR so RiC-O's open vocabulary can grow without migrations. Common predicates: `ric:isOrWasLocatedAt`, `ric:isOrWasResidentAt`, `ric:isOrWasPerformedAt`, `ric:isOrWasIncludedIn`. Each row carries optional `qualifier`, `certainty` (certain/probable/uncertain), `date_start`/`date_end` for temporal validity, `source_ref` for the documentary citation, and `created_by` to track curatorial provenance.
- **Why polymorphic, not 16 specialised link tables** — RiC-O has dozens of inter-entity predicates. One link table per (source, target, predicate) triple would explode the schema and add a migration on every new predicate. Polymorphic source/target keeps the schema compact; the application-layer validator (`validateRelationEndpoints`) checks both endpoints exist and are not soft-deleted before INSERT.
- **Two new public endpoints**:
  - `GET /archives/places/{id}/ric.json` — RiC-O JSON-LD for one place. Emits `ric:Place`, `ric:CoordinateLocation` from lat/lng, `owl:sameAs` to GeoNames / Wikidata / Getty TGN, `ric:isOrWasIncludedIn` to the parent place, and `ric:isAssociatedWithDate` for historical date ranges.
  - `GET /archives/places/ric.json` — synthetic `ric:RecordSet` listing every top-level place (those with `parent_id IS NULL`), suitable for harvesting alongside the existing collection / agents / activities endpoints.
- **`RicJsonLdBuilder::buildRelationNode()`** — new method that renders any `archive_relations` row as a `ric:Relation` JSON-LD node with deterministic `@id` (`/archives/relations/{row.id}`), `ric:relationHasSource` and `ric:relationHasTarget` resolved via the central `iriForEntity()` switch. Returns `null` on malformed input — no exception — so callers can drop bad rows from the output without crashing the whole response.
- **`validateRelationEndpoints(sourceType, sourceId, targetType, targetId)`** — application-layer integrity check used by the admin form before inserting into `archive_relations`. Verifies both endpoints exist and are not soft-deleted; the polymorphic column shape makes a SQL FK impossible.
- **Migration `migrate_0.7.10.sql`** — idempotent. `archive_places.parent_id` self-cycle guards live in the application layer (MySQL forbids CHECK on a column that's part of an `ON DELETE SET NULL` FK action, same constraint encountered in Phase 3).

## What's New in v0.7.9

### Archives: RiC-CM Phase 3 — Activities as first-class entities ([#122](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/122))

Third milestone of the RiC-CM roadmap. Introduces the ISDF-aligned **Activity** entity — any human or organisational activity that produced, used, or managed archival material. Phase 1 + Phase 2 already gave us records, record sets, and agents; Phase 3 closes the "what happened" side of the RiC-CM triangle.

- **New table `archive_activities`** — first-class Activity entity. Columns: `title`, `description`, `activity_type` (`function` / `activity` / `transaction` / `task` / `mandate` per ISDF terminology), self-referential `parent_id` (so a function can contain activities, an activity can contain transactions), `date_start` / `date_end` / `is_ongoing`, optional `agent_id` FK to `authority_records` (the agent that performed the activity), `place_id` reserved for Phase 4, `source_ref` for the legal/normative citation (e.g. "RD 9 ottobre 1861 n. 250"), full-text index on title + description.
- **New table `archive_unit_activities`** — M:N link between archival units and activities. The `ric_predicate` column captures the semantics of each link as a RiC-O predicate: `ric:resultsOrResultedFrom` (the unit was produced by the activity, default), `ric:isOrWasUsedBy` (the unit was used during the activity), `ric:isSubjectOf` (the activity is about this unit). Column is VARCHAR so new predicates can be added without a migration.
- **Two new public endpoints**:
  - `GET /archives/activities/{id}/ric.json` — RiC-O JSON-LD for one activity, with `ric:Activity` type, `ric:isOrWasPerformedBy` → agent, `ric:hasOrHadPartOf` → parent activity, `ric:isAssociatedWithDate` as `ric:DateRange` (`xsd:date`), and `ric:isOrWasRelatedTo` listing every unit the activity produced / used.
  - `GET /archives/activities/ric.json` — synthetic `ric:RecordSet` listing every top-level activity (those with `parent_id IS NULL`), suitable for ICA / Europeana harvesting alongside the existing collection.ric.json and agents endpoints.
- **`/archives/{id}/ric.json` now embeds activity links** — `RicJsonLdBuilder::buildUnit()` accepts a new `$activities` parameter so the unit-side serialisation lists every activity it's connected to. The relation IRI is shared between the unit side and the activity side (`/archives/unit-activity-relations/{unitId}-{activityId}-{predicate-slug}`) so a graph-merge consumer collapses both emissions into a single RDF node.
- **Migration `migrate_0.7.9.sql`** — idempotent. The CHECK constraint guarding `parent_id <> id` is intentionally absent because MySQL rejects CHECK on a column that's part of a FK referential action (`ON DELETE SET NULL`); the application-layer cycle guard in `activityWouldCreateCycle()` provides the equivalent protection.

## What's New in v0.7.8

### Archives: RiC-CM Phase 2 — Agents as first-class entities ([#122](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/122))

Phase 2 of the 6-phase RiC-CM roadmap. Phase 1 (v0.7.7) was schema-free; this is the first migration in the chain that touches the DB.

- **`authority_records` extended** — four new columns:
  - `ric_type` (`ENUM('Person','CorporateBody','Family','Position','Group')`) — RiC-CM canonical type, broader than the legacy ISAAR `type` enum. The migration backfills it from existing `type` values; `Position` and `Group` are RiC-CM-only types ISAAR doesn't model.
  - `birth_date` / `death_date` — structured begin/end-of-existence dates (`xsd:date`). The RiC-O JSON-LD output now emits `ric:beginningDate` and `ric:endDate` as typed literals instead of the free-text `dates_of_existence` blob (which is preserved for back-compat and surfaces as `ric:descriptiveNote` on pre-Phase-2 rows).
  - `place_of_origin` — birthplace / founding place. Phase 4 will swap this literal for a FK to a dedicated `archive_places` table.
- **New table `archive_agent_identifiers`** — multi-scheme identifier ledger for archive authorities (VIAF, ISNI, Wikidata, GND, BNF, LCNAF, Getty ULAN, ARK, local). Each row carries scheme + value + optional precomputed URI + an `is_preferred` flag. `collectSameAsForAuthority` now merges these into `owl:sameAs` alongside the existing `viaf-authority` plugin's data; rows without a precomputed URI are synthesised from the scheme's canonical prefix (e.g. `viaf:29539` → `https://viaf.org/viaf/29539`).
- **New table `archive_agent_relations`** — Agent ↔ Agent edges typed with a RiC-O predicate (`ric:isParentOf`, `ric:isMemberOf`, `ric:isSuccessorOf`, `ric:isMarriedTo`, ...). Captures organisational hierarchies, corporate successions, and family ties that ISAAR's flat table cannot express. Each row becomes a `ric:Relation` node in the RiC-O JSON-LD output with a deterministic `@id` of the form `{base}/archives/agent-relations/{agentId}-{relatedId}-{predicate-slug}`. The schema rejects self-loops via a `CHECK` constraint (MySQL 8.0.16+).
- **Migration `migrate_0.7.8.sql`** — fully idempotent (INFORMATION_SCHEMA guards on every ALTER, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` on every CREATE). Re-running the migration is safe; the ric_type backfill UPDATE narrows on rows still at the default value so curator overrides survive.

## What's New in v0.7.7

### Regression hotfix for author autocomplete ([#74](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/74))

- **Issue #74 regression fix** — typing a new author name in the book form and pressing Enter was once again selecting the first highlighted dropdown match (e.g. typing "Norbert Wex" picked the existing "Norbert Bauer") instead of creating the new author. The original fix in v0.4.9.4 monkey-patched `authorsChoice._onEnterKey` on the Choices.js instance; a later "cleaner" refactor (commit `e976cb1e`) replaced it with a capture-phase keydown listener, which Choices.js v11 silently bypasses via `stopImmediatePropagation()` on its own pre-registered capture-phase handler. Restored the monkey-patch with a defensive capture-phase fallback for any future Choices.js version that removes `_onEnterKey`. The override is per-instance, so publisher / genre / etc. Choices instances on the same page keep stock behaviour.

This is a patch-only release. No schema migrations, no plugin changes,
no config changes required. Drop-in upgrade from v0.7.6.

## What's New in v0.7.6

### French locale (fr_FR) and BNF scraping

- **Full French translation** — 4,145 translated keys (100% coverage). Select `fr_FR` during the installation wizard to run Pinakes in French; existing installations can switch the default locale from Settings → Localisation.
- **BNF SRU scraping** — the Z39 Server plugin now connects to the Bibliothèque nationale de France SRU endpoint and maps UNIMARC fields to Pinakes metadata (title, authors, publisher, ISBN, Dewey, subjects). Enable the Z39 Server plugin and add `sru.bnf.fr` as a source to start importing French bibliographic records.
- **Migration hardening** — `migrate_0.7.5.sql` now uses `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` instead of `INSERT IGNORE`, ensuring `fr_FR` is correctly re-activated on upgrades where the language row already existed with `is_active=0`. `Language::setDefault()` now forces `is_active=1` on the target language to prevent an inconsistent state where the default locale is invisible to the resolution chain.
- **Dev-schema guard** — `migrate_0.7.0.sql` detects installations where `author_authority_alternates` was created with the legacy column name `source_code` and automatically drops and recreates the table, preventing a fatal `ADD KEY` error during upgrade.

### Archives: IIIF Presentation 3.0 and AtoM alignment ([#123](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/123), [#121](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/121))

- **IIIF Presentation 3.0 manifests** — `GET /archives/{id}/manifest.json` returns a standards-compliant IIIF 3.0 manifest for each archival unit, exposing attached digitised documents as `Canvas` items with painting `Annotation`s. Works out of the box with Universal Viewer, Mirador, and other IIIF viewers.
- **AtoM ISAD(G) area labels** — the Archives admin UI and public display now use canonical ISAD(G) area names (`Identity area`, `Context area`, `Content and structure area`, `Conditions of access and use area`, `Allied materials area`, `Notes area`) so records are immediately recognisable to users coming from AtoM or other archival systems.
- **Multi-document uploads** — archival units now support multiple attached digitised files (PDF, JPEG, TIFF). Each file is stored with its original name, MIME type, and display order.

### Security fixes

- **Open-redirect via Host spoofing** — the OpenURL resolver built redirect URLs directly from `$request->getUri()->getHost()`, bypassing the `APP_TRUSTED_HOSTS` guard in `HtmlHelper::getBaseUrl()`. A crafted `Host:` header could redirect users to an attacker-controlled domain. Fixed to use `absoluteUrl()`.
- **CQL injection in SRU client** — search terms containing `"` or `\` were embedded in CQL quoted-term syntax without escaping, producing malformed queries sent to external SRU endpoints (BNF, SUDOC). Fixed with proper backslash escaping per the CQL specification.

### Compatibility fixes

- **Windows updater** ([#130](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/130)) — path separators are now normalised to forward slashes before version-file lookups; backslash paths on Windows caused the updater to silently fail.
- **German routes** — added the missing `bibframe.book` route key to `routes_de_DE.json`, bringing German routing to parity with Italian, English, and French.

## What's New in v0.7.4

> Releases v0.6.x through v0.7.4 focused on library interoperability and archive search. All changes are listed below newest-first.

### Archive search bar — admin + public (v0.7.4)

The **Archives** plugin now ships a full search interface on both the admin and the public catalog.

**Admin (`/admin/archives?q=…&level=…`)**
- Free-text search hits `reference_code` (LIKE, for short codes like `IT-MI-001`), `constructed_title`/`formal_title` (LIKE), and `scope_content`/`archival_history` (MySQL FULLTEXT — two-pass query, deduplicated).
- Level filter (`fonds` / `series` / `file` / `item`) narrows by archival hierarchy without a separate page.
- Search mode renders a flat list instead of the tree indent, making all matched nodes equally scannable regardless of depth.
- Result counter (`N risultati per "query" · livello: series`) and input persistence (query + selected level remain filled after submission).
- "Azzera" reset link returns to the full hierarchical tree.

**Public (`/archivio?q=…&level=…&date_from=…&date_to=…`)**
- Same text + level filters plus a **date range** filter: `date_from` matches units whose `date_end ≥ year`; `date_to` matches units whose `date_start ≤ year`; both can be combined for an overlap query.
- In search mode results include all hierarchy levels (series, files, items), not just root fonds — so a reference-code search for `IT-MI-ARC-001/2` finds the exact fascicolo.
- Theme-aware CSS (`.archive-search-form`) reads `--primary-color` / `--archives-color-primary` so the form inherits whatever palette the admin chose in Settings → Appearance.
- × reset button clears all filters back to the root catalog.

**Bug fixes included**
- `reference_code` was previously not searchable at all — the old endpoint used only FULLTEXT, which skips tokens shorter than `ft_min_word_len` (3); the new two-pass strategy uses LIKE first.
- Level filter was silently ignored due to a PHP associative-array bug (`in_array` was checking integer values `[1,2,3,4]` instead of string keys `['fonds','series',…]`); corrected to `isset(self::LEVELS[$level])`.

**E2E coverage**: `tests/archives-search.spec.js` — 25 serial tests covering admin search (15) and public search (10), run with `/tmp/run-e2e.sh tests/archives-search.spec.js --config=tests/playwright.config.js --workers=1`.

### Interoperability stack — OAI-PMH, NCIP, BIBFRAME, ResourceSync, OpenURL, VIAF (v0.7.x)

Pinakes v0.7.x introduced a full library-interoperability layer, delivered as opt-in plugins that activate without touching the core schema.

**OAI-PMH 2.0 data provider** (`/archives/oai`)
- Exposes archival units as OAI-PMH records. Supports `Identify`, `ListMetadataFormats` (`oai_dc`, `marc21`), `ListSets` (one set per ISAD level), `ListRecords`, `GetRecord`, and resumption-token-based pagination.
- Dublin Core crosswalk from ISAD fields (title, description, date, identifier, type); MARCXML crosswalk from the same ABA field mapping used by the SRU endpoint.
- Selective harvesting by set (`level:fonds`, `level:series`, …) and by `from`/`until` date range (uses `updated_at`).

**NCIP 2.02 server**
- Implements the NISO Circulation Interchange Protocol: `LookupUser`, `LookupItem`, `CheckOutItem`, `CheckInItem`, `RenewItem`, `RequestItem`, `CancelRequestItem`.
- Partner library management UI at `/admin/plugins/ncip-server/partners` and `/admin/plugins/ncip-server/transactions` — register external systems with shared secret, set borrowing quotas.
- Maps Pinakes loan/reservation/user records onto NCIP data elements; returns structured NCIP XML responses.

**BIBFRAME 2.0 linked-data export**
- `GET /api/bibframe/book/{id}` — emits JSON-LD `bf:Work` + `bf:Instance` for books.
- `GET /api/bibframe/book/{id}/work` — `bf:Work` only.
- `GET /api/bibframe/book/{id}/instance` — `bf:Instance` only.
- Includes `bf:title`, `bf:contribution` (authors as `bf:Agent`), `bf:subject` (keywords), `bf:genreForm`, `bf:classification` (Dewey), `bf:language`, `bf:identifiedBy` (ISBN-13, EAN), and persistent `/id/work/{id}` + `/id/instance/{id}` URIs.

**ResourceSync**
- `GET /.well-known/resourcesync` — W3C ResourceSync source description.
- `GET /resync/capabilitylist.xml` — capability list linking to resource list and change list.
- `GET /resync/resourcelist.xml` — enumeration of all book and archive URLs with `md:hash` (MD5) and `md:lastmod`.
- `GET /resync/changelist.xml` — incremental change log (created/updated/deleted) since a given `from` date.

**OpenURL / COinS**
- OpenURL 1.0 resolver at `/openurl` — parses `ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004` + `rft.*` parameters, resolves to full-text link, catalog record, or ILL form.
- COinS `<span class="Z3988">` auto-embedded in public book detail pages for Zotero/Mendeley browser extensions.

**VIAF auto-linking**
- Scheduled task checks unlinked `authority_records` against the VIAF SRU endpoint; fills `viaf_id` for exact-name matches.
- Admin UI at `/admin/archives/authorities` shows VIAF reconciliation status per record and allows manual override.

**Documentation**: full technical guides (IT + EN) published at <https://fabiodalez-dev.github.io/Pinakes/> — one page per protocol.

### Membership consistency hardening + performance indexes (v0.5.9.6)

- `libri_collane` now enforces a CHECK constraint (`chk_lc_principale_consistency`) so a row can never have `tipo_appartenenza='principale'` together with `is_principale=0` (or vice versa). Pre-fix the column defaults silently allowed that contradictory state.
- The column default for `is_principale` was aligned to `1` to match the `'principale'` default of `tipo_appartenenza`, removing the foot-gun for any future plugin/CSV/scraper that omits the flag.
- Existing rows are realigned in-place by an idempotent migration; no data loss, no manual steps required.
- Six performance indexes backfilled for existing installations via `migrate_0.5.9.6.sql`: `idx_origine` and `idx_libro_utente` on `prestiti`; `idx_tipo_utente` on `utenti`; `idx_stato_libro`, `idx_queue_position` on `prenotazioni`. Fresh installs already had these via `schema.sql`; upgrades from any prior version now receive them automatically.

### Series groups and cycles (v0.5.9.5)

- Collane now support an optional umbrella group for related spin-offs, universes, or franchises, so separate series like `Fairy Tail`, `Fairy Tail: 100 Year Quest`, and `Fairy Tail: Happy` can remain distinct while sharing one parent group.
- Collane also support an optional cycle/season label plus numeric ordering, matching LibraryThing-style series such as `The Worlds of Aldebaran` with `Cycle 1`, `Cycle 2`, and later arcs.
- Book create/edit forms can set group, cycle/season, cycle order, series name, and series number in one flow; the Collane admin page exposes the same metadata and shows related series in the same group.

### Archives plugin (ISAD(G) / ISAAR(CPF))

New bundled plugin for archival material alongside the bibliographic
catalog — hierarchical descriptions (Fondo → Series → File → Item) per
[ISAD(G)](https://www.ica.org/en/isadg-general-international-standard-archival-description-second-edition),
authority records per
[ISAAR(CPF)](https://www.ica.org/en/isaar-cpf-international-standard-archival-authority-record-corporate-bodies-persons-and-families-2nd).

**Archival descriptions**

- Three tables (`archival_units`, `authority_records`, `archival_unit_authority`)
  with self-referencing tree, FK guards, MARC-like field crosswalk inspired
  by the ABA format (Arbejderbevægelsens Bibliotek og Arkiv).
- Admin CRUD at `/admin/archives`, public frontend at `/archivio` (card grid
  + detail pages styled to match the book detail, SEO slug URLs, JSON-LD
  `ArchiveComponent` schema, breadcrumb chain).
- Per-unit cover image + document uploads (PDF/ePub/MP3/video) with finfo
  MIME detection and path-prefix unlink guard.

**Authority records (ISAAR(CPF))**

- Full CRUD for persons / corporate bodies / families with M:N linkage
  to both `archival_units` and `libri.autori` (unified authority file
  for the whole catalog, not per-module).
- JS type-ahead picker for attaching an existing authority to an
  archival unit (admin form) — no manual ID entry.
- Unified cross-entity search: a single query returns hits across
  `libri` + `archival_units` + `authority_records` with the correct
  provenance label in the results.

**Photographic items**

- Dedicated `specific_material` ENUM on `archival_units` covering the
  full ABA billedmarc / MARC21 008-pos-33 catalogue (`hb`/`hp`/`hm`/`hd`/`hk`/
  `bf`/`hf`/`lm`/`lf`/`vm`/`bm`/`le`/`zz`…) so a photograph, postcard,
  drawing, map, or audio-visual item gets classified correctly rather
  than flattened to "item".

**MARCXML I/O + SRU**

- MARCXML import + export, round-trip-stable (identity test: export →
  import → re-export yields byte-identical output), validated against
  the MARC21 Slim XSD on both sides.
- SRU 1.2 endpoint for archival records so external discovery systems
  (OPACs, union catalogues, Z39.50/SRU gateways) can query the archive
  alongside the book catalogue.

**Packaging**

- Plugin ships **inactive** (`metadata.optional: true`). Activate in
  Admin → Plugins to create the schema.
- i18n: IT/EN/DE (~40 new keys). Tracks
  [#103](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/103).

### Discogs catalog number (Cat#) support

`DiscogsPlugin::validateBarcode` now accepts Catalog Numbers
(`CDP 7912682`, `SRX-6272`, `DGC-24425-2`) alongside EAN-13/UPC-A.
`ScrapeController::byIsbn` preserves the raw identifier through the
`scrape.isbn.validate` hook chain so plugins can match non-numeric
inputs. Valid ISBN-10 codes ending in `X` (`080442957X`) are explicitly
vetoed from Cat# classification to avoid music-metadata merges into book
records (MOD-11 checksum in `DiscogsPlugin::isIsbn10`, 7 regression
asserts in `tests/discogs-catno.unit.php`). Closes
[#101](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/101).

### Remember-me preserves user locale

Users whose `utenti.locale` differs from the install default
(a `de_DE` user on an `it_IT` install) now see their locale restored
after auto-login. Fix is in installer seed + a backfill migration:
`installer/database/data_{it_IT,en_US}.sql` seed all three shipped
locales, `migrate_0.5.9.1.sql` adds the missing row on existing
installs. Closes [#108](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/108).

### Migration

`migrate_0.5.9.sql` creates archival plugin tables + indexes.
`migrate_0.5.9.1.sql` seeds missing locales. Both idempotent via
`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` guards and `INSERT IGNORE`.

### Release-pipeline hardening (v0.5.9.2 → v0.5.9.4)

The 0.5.9.x series took four hotfix iterations because a forgotten
GitHub Actions workflow (`release.yml`) was racing
`scripts/create-release.sh` and overwriting the published ZIP with a
stale build that only contained 5 of 10 bundled plugins. The rogue
workflow is now disabled, `bin/build-release.sh` enumerates plugins
from the filesystem instead of a hardcoded list, and
`scripts/create-release.sh` verifies the shipped ZIP via the GitHub
API (uploader identity + SHA + plugin count, polled for 90s) so no
third-party overwrite can slip through unnoticed. Full post-mortem
in `updater.md`.

<summary><strong>v0.5.4</strong> - Discogs Plugin + Media Type + Plugin Manager Hardening</summary>

### Discogs music scraper plugin (#87)

- **New `tipo_media` ENUM** (`libro/disco/audiolibro/dvd/altro`) on `libri` with composite index `(deleted_at, tipo_media)`
- **Heuristic backfill** from `formato` using anchored LIKE patterns (avoids `%cd%` matching CD-ROM, `%lp%` matching "help")
- **Discogs + MusicBrainz + CoverArtArchive + Deezer** chain with 4 hooks (incl. `scrape.isbn.validate` for UPC-12/13)
- **Barcode → ISBN guard** in `ScrapeController::normalizeIsbnFields` — skips normalization when no format/tipo_media signal to avoid the EAN-in-`isbn13` regression
- **PluginManager** migrated from `error_log` → `SecureLogger` (31 call sites)

### Post-release hotfixes (rolled into v0.5.4)

- `autoRegisterBundledPlugins` INSERT had 14 columns / 13 values after CodeRabbit round 11 — fresh installs crashed with "Column count doesn't match value count" (fixed in `c9bd82c`)
- Same method's `bind_param('ssssssssissss')` had positions 8+9 swapped — `path='discogs'` was cast to int `0`, orphan-detection then deleted the rows (fixed in `fb1e881`)

## Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository and upload all files to the root directory of your server.
2. **Visit your site's root URL** in the browser — the guided installer starts automatically.
3. **Provide database credentials** (database must be empty).
4. **Select language** (Italian, English, French, or German).
5. **Configure** organization name, logo, and email notifications.
6. **Create admin account** and start cataloging.

**Email configuration**: Supports both PHP `mail()` and SMTP. Required for notifications to work (loan confirmations, due-date reminders, registration approvals, reservation alerts). Can be configured during installation or later from the admin panel.

**Post-install** (optional but recommended):
- Remove/lock the `installer/` directory (button provided on final step)
- Configure SMTP, registration policy, and CMS blocks from **Admin → Settings**
- Schedule cron jobs for automated tasks:
  ```bash
  # Notifications every hour (8 AM - 8 PM)
  0 8-20 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron/automatic-notifications.php >> /var/log/biblioteca-cron.log 2>&1

  # Full maintenance at 6 AM (handles reservation/pickup expirations)
  0 6 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron/full-maintenance.php >> /var/log/biblioteca-maintenance.log 2>&1
  ```

All frontend assets are precompiled. Works on shared hosting. No Composer or build tools required on production. All configuration values can be changed later from the admin panel.

## Story Behind the Name

**Pinakes** comes from the ancient Greek word *πίνακες* ("tables" or "catalogues"). Callimachus of Cyrene compiled the *Pinakes* around 245 BC for the Library of Alexandria: 120 scrolls that indexed more than 120,000 works with authorship, subject and location. This project borrows that same mission—organising and sharing knowledge with modern tools.

**Full documentation**: [fabiodalez-dev.github.io/Pinakes](https://fabiodalez-dev.github.io/Pinakes/)

## What It Does

Pinakes provides cataloging, circulation, a self-service public frontend, and REST APIs out of the box. It ships with precompiled frontend assets and a guided installer so you can deploy quickly on standard LAMP hosting.

### Archival Records — ISAD(G) + ISAAR(CPF)

Shipped as the bundled **Archives** plugin (opt-in; activate from Admin → Plugins). Lets the same Pinakes install manage both a book catalogue *and* a hierarchical archive — fonds, series, files, items — according to the international archival standards used by public archives, historical societies, photographic collections, and academic repositories.

**Hierarchical archival description (ISAD(G) 2nd ed.)**
- Four-level hierarchy: `fonds` → `series` → `file` → `item`. Each row is a standalone ISAD(G) record with `parent_id` chaining up to an arbitrary depth (real archives are usually 2-4 deep).
- Full identity area (3.1): reference code, institution code, formal + constructed title, date range (start/end + predominant dates + significant gaps), extent, language codes.
- Context & content (3.2-3.3): archival history, acquisition source, scope & content, appraisal/destruction schedule, accruals policy, system of arrangement.
- Access & use (3.4): access conditions, reproduction rules, language/script notes, physical characteristics, finding aids.
- Allied materials (3.5): originals/copies location, related units.
- Soft-delete aligned with the library-side `libri` convention (deleted rows vanish from views, still queryable for restore).
- Descendant-cycle guard: an edit that would make a unit its own descendant is rejected with a validation error (walks ancestors up to 100 hops).

**Authority records (ISAAR(CPF))**
- Dedicated table, separate from `autori`, because ISAAR covers persons **and** corporate bodies **and** families — a richer element set than bibliographic authors.
- Identity (5.1): type, authorised form, parallel forms, other forms, identifiers (VIAF / ISNI / ORCID).
- Context (5.2): dates of existence, history, places, legal status, functions/occupations, mandates, internal structure/genealogy, general context, gender.
- M:N linking to archival units with MARC-aligned roles: `creator` / `subject` / `recipient` / `custodian` / `associated`.
- Cross-reconciliation with the library-side `autori` table via `autori_authority_link` — unifies books and archives under a single person/entity in the public search.

**Photographic & audio-visual materials (ABA billedmarc)**
- `specific_material` ENUM with 15 ABA codes: text (bf), photograph (hf), poster (hp), postcard (hm), drawing (hd), map (hk), picture (hb), 3D object/realia (ho), audio recording (lm), motion-picture film (lf), video (vm), microform (bm), electronic/born-digital (le), mixed materials (zz), other.
- Dedicated columns for colour mode (bw / colour / mixed), dimensions, photographer, publisher, collection name, local classification — matching the MARC 300/337/338 content/media/carrier vocabulary.

**Per-document digital assets** (v0.7.6+)
- Each archival unit can hold a cover image plus multiple downloadable digitised files (PDF / ePub / audio / video). Files are stored under `public/storage/archives/{unit_id}/` with original filename, MIME type, and display order. Drag-and-drop upload from the admin form; per-file delete with admin confirmation.

**Multi-format export — MARCXML, EAD3, METS, UNIMARC, Dublin Core**
- **MARCXML** (Library of Congress MARC21 Slim): `GET /admin/archives/{id}/export.xml` and `GET /admin/archives/export.xml?ids=…` emit ABA-crosswalk MARCXML via XMLWriter. Authorities exported as 100/110/600/610/700/710 tags depending on `(type, role)`.
- **EAD3** (archivists.org Encoded Archival Description): `GET /admin/archives/export.ead3` emits a full EAD3 finding aid. Mirrors what AtoM, ArchivesSpace, and the national portals consume.
- **METS** (Library of Congress Metadata Encoding & Transmission): `GET /archives/{id}/mets.xml` packages descriptive metadata + IIIF manifest link + digitised assets into a single METS document for OAI-PMH MAG harvesting (Internet Culturale / ICCU).
- **UNIMARC** (IFLA): exposed via SRU/OAI-PMH for federation with BNF and Italian SBN partners.
- **Dublin Core** (oai_dc): `GET /archives/{id}/dc.xml` and via OAI-PMH below.
- **Import**: `POST /admin/archives/import` parses MARCXML (SimpleXML) with optional XSD validation against the Library of Congress MARC21 Slim v1.1 schema. UPSERT on `(institution_code, reference_code)` — re-importing the same file is idempotent. Dry-run preview available.

**SRU 1.2 read-only endpoint**
- `GET /api/archives/sru` — supports `explain`, `searchRetrieve` (CQL subset: `title`, `reference`, `level`, `anywhere`, joined with `AND`), and `scan` stub. External catalogues (Reindex, Koha, ARKIS, BNF) can federate-search the archive using MARCXML records.

**IIIF Presentation 3.0** ([#123](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/123), v0.7.6+)
- `GET /archives/{id}/manifest.json` returns a standards-compliant IIIF Presentation 3.0 manifest for every archival unit, exposing attached digitised documents as `Canvas` items with painting `Annotation`s. Works out of the box with **Universal Viewer**, **Mirador**, and any other IIIF-compatible viewer.
- `GET /archives/collection.json` and `GET /archives/{id}/collection.json` emit IIIF Collection documents for the root fonds list and per-unit sub-collections.
- The manifest's `seeAlso` block points to every alternative serialisation (Dublin Core, EAD3, METS, RiC-O, OAI-PMH record, ARK identifier) so an IIIF-aware client can discover the full graph of metadata representations with no second discovery round-trip.

**RiC-O JSON-LD** (Records in Contexts Ontology, ICA 2023 — [#122](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/122), v0.7.7+)
- `GET /archives/{id}/ric.json` and `GET /archives/agents/{id}/ric.json` emit RiC-O JSON-LD for archival units and authority records — the linked-data successor to ISAD(G)/ISAAR. Each role on `archival_unit_authority` maps to a typed predicate (`ric:isCreatorOf`, `ric:isOrWasCustodianOf`, `ric:isSubjectOf`, `ric:isAddresseeOf`, `ric:isAssociatedWith`).
- `GET /archives/collection.ric.json` emits a synthetic `ric:RecordSet` aggregating all top-level fonds, suitable for harvesting by Europeana, ArchivesPortalEurope, and the ICA aggregator.
- `owl:sameAs` URIs are gathered transparently from the `viaf-authority` plugin's authority links and filtered through a strict scheme allow-list (`http(s)`, `urn`, `ark`, `info`, `doi`) before emission.

**AtoM ISAD(G) area labels** ([#121](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/121), v0.7.6+)
- The admin UI and public display now use the canonical ISAD(G) area names (`Identity area`, `Context area`, `Content and structure area`, `Conditions of access and use area`, `Allied materials area`, `Notes area`), so records are immediately recognisable to users coming from AtoM or other archival catalogue software.

**ARK persistent identifiers + rightsstatements.org** (v0.7.x)
- Each archival unit can carry an ARK identifier (Archival Resource Key) — emitted as `https://n2t.net/{ark}` in the IIIF `seeAlso` and the RiC-O `rdfs:seeAlso` blocks.
- Rights are expressed via a `rightsstatements.org` URI (e.g., `https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/`) — mapped to `ric:Rule` + `owl:sameAs` in the RiC-O output.

**Unified cross-entity search**
- `/admin/archives/search` hits three sources in a single query: `archival_units` (FULLTEXT on title + scope + archival_history), `authority_records` (FULLTEXT on authorised_form + history + functions), and `autori` rows reconciled to an authority.

**Search bars (admin + public)**
- **Admin** (`/admin/archives?q=…&level=…`): two-pass query — LIKE on `reference_code` first (short archival codes like `IT-MI-001` are below FULLTEXT's `ft_min_word_len`), then FULLTEXT on title/scope/history. Level filter narrows to one archival tier. Search mode renders results as a flat list (no hierarchy indent). Result counter and input persistence.
- **Public** (`/archivio?q=…&level=…&date_from=…&date_to=…`): same text + level filters plus date-range overlap (`date_from` / `date_to`). In search mode all hierarchy levels are returned (not just root fonds), so a user can search directly for a series or fascicolo by reference code. Theme-aware CSS.

**OAI-PMH 2.0 data provider**
- `GET /oai` (exposed by the OAI-PMH server plugin) advertises archival units alongside book records via `set=archives`: `Identify`, `ListMetadataFormats` (oai_dc + marc21 + ead3 + ric-o for archival_unit), `ListSets` (per ISAD level), `ListRecords`/`GetRecord` with resumption tokens, selective harvesting by set + date range.

**Plugin integration**
- Self-contained at `storage/plugins/archives/`. Wires up through two `plugin_hooks` rows (`app.routes.register`, `admin.menu.render`) on activation; deactivation removes the route + sidebar entry without touching DB data.
- Full i18n (IT/EN/DE) with ICA-ISAD(G) terminology (IT) / ICA (EN) / ICA-Deutsch (DE: Bestand / Signatur / Einzelstück).
- Migration `migrate_0.5.9.sql` is fully idempotent (INFORMATION_SCHEMA guards + conditional ALTERs) — safe to re-run on partial installs, cleanly extends the ENUM on upgrades.

### Plugin System
Extend without modifying core files. Plugins can implement:
- New metadata scrapers (custom APIs, proprietary databases)
- Additional business logic (custom loan rules, notifications)
- Digital-content modules (eBooks, audiobooks, streaming)

---

## Plugins (Pre-installed)

All plugins are located in `storage/plugins/` and can be managed from **Admin → Plugins**.

### 1. Open Library (`open-library-v1.0.1.zip`)
- **Metadata scraping** from Open Library API
- **Fallback to Google Books** when Open Library lacks data
- **Automatic cover download** with validation
- **Subject mapping** and language normalization
- **Configurable priority** and caching options

### 2. Z39 Server (`z39-server-v1.2.3.zip`)

Implements the **SRU (Search/Retrieve via URL)** protocol, the HTTP-based successor to Z39.50, enabling catalog interoperability with library systems worldwide.

**Server Mode** (expose your catalog):
- **SRU 1.2 API** at `/api/sru` with explain, searchRetrieve, scan operations
- **Export formats**: MARCXML, Dublin Core, MODS, OAI_DC
- **CQL query parser** supporting indexes: `dc.title`, `dc.creator`, `dc.subject`, `bath.isbn`, `dc.publisher`, `dc.date`

**Client Mode** (import from external catalogs):
- **Copy cataloging** from Z39.50/SRU servers (Library of Congress, OCLC, K10plus, SUDOC, national libraries)
- **SBN Italia client** — Automatic metadata retrieval from Italian national library catalog
- **BNF (Bibliothèque nationale de France) client** (v0.7.6+) — UNIMARC scraping from the BNF SRU endpoint with field mapping to Pinakes metadata (title, authors, publisher, ISBN, Dewey, subjects). Enable Z39 Server and add `sru.bnf.fr` as a source to start importing French bibliographic records.
- **UNIMARC parser** — Handles UNIMARC field codes (200, 210, 215, 700/701/702, 676 for Dewey) in addition to MARC21, so French + Italian + Swiss + Belgian + Quebecois catalogues are all consumable
- **Dewey classification extraction**:
  - SBN: Parses Dewey codes from `classificazioneDewey` field (format: `335.4092 (19.) SISTEMI MARXIANI`)
  - SRU/MARCXML: Extracts from MARC field 082 (Dewey Decimal Classification Number)

**Example queries**:
```bash
# Server info
curl "http://yoursite.com/api/sru?operation=explain"

# Search by author
curl "http://yoursite.com/api/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&query=dc.creator=marx&maximumRecords=10"

- **Multi-language support** — Separate JSON files for Italian (`dewey_completo_it.json`) and English (`dewey_completo_en.json`) with full translations
- **Inline editing** — Add, modify, or delete categories with instant validation
- **Validation engine** — Checks code format (XXX.XXXX), hierarchy consistency, and duplicate detection

**Data Exchange**:
- **JSON import/export** — Backup and restore classification data for manual editing or exchange with other Pinakes installations
- **Cross-installation sharing** — Export your customized Dewey database and import it into another Pinakes instance
- **Merge capability** — Import external classifications while preserving existing entries

**Automatic Dewey Scraping**:
- **SBN integration** — When scraping book metadata from SBN (Italian National Library), Dewey codes are automatically extracted from the `classificazioneDewey` field
- **SRU/Z39.50 servers** — Dewey codes extracted from MARC field 082 when querying external catalogs (K10plus, SUDOC, Library of Congress, etc.)
- **Auto-population** — New Dewey codes discovered during scraping are automatically added to your JSON database (language-aware: only updates when source language matches app locale)
- **CSV import enrichment** — Books imported via CSV are automatically enriched with Dewey classification through ISBN scraping

**Dewey Code Format**:
- Main classes: `000`-`999` (3 digits)
- Subdivisions: `000.1` to `999.9999` (up to 4 decimal places)

### 6. Archives (`archives`)

ISAD(G) / ISAAR(CPF) hierarchical archival records — see [Archival Records](#archival-records--isadg--isaarcpf) in Core Features for the full feature breakdown (IIIF 3.0 manifests, RiC-O JSON-LD export, MARCXML / EAD3 / METS / UNIMARC / Dublin Core, SRU 1.2, OAI-PMH 2.0, AtoM area labels, ARK identifiers, photographic-material support).

### 7. VIAF Authority Control (`viaf-authority`)

Bibliographic authority control linking authors to the **Virtual International Authority File** (VIAF, OCLC) and **ISNI** (ISO 27729).

- **Authority enrichment** — Adds `viaf_id` / `viaf_uri` / `isni_id` / `isni_uri` columns to the `autori` table; `authority_source` (manual / viaf / isni / sbn / wikidata) records where each binding came from
- **Confidence scoring** — Each authority binding carries an `authority_confidence` (exact / probable / candidate / rejected) so curators can review weak matches
- **VIAF AutoSuggest** — Type-ahead search in the author edit form queries the VIAF AutoSuggest API directly
- **W3C Reconciliation API** — `/api/viaf/reconcile` endpoint compatible with OpenRefine and other reconciliation clients
- **ISNI check-digit validation** — Rejects malformed 16-character ISNI strings before they reach the DB
- **Authority alternates** — `author_authority_alternates` table holds additional identifier candidates (Wikidata, BNF, GND, etc.) for future scheme expansion
- **Used by**: the Archives plugin's RiC-O JSON-LD output pulls `owl:sameAs` URIs from these tables so books and archives surface the same persons under a unified Linked-Data identity

### 8. OAI-PMH Server (`oai-pmh-server`)

OAI-PMH 2.0 data provider exposing the **book catalogue + archives** to national and international harvesters (Internet Culturale / ICCU, Europeana, DPLA).

- **Endpoint**: `GET/POST /oai` — supports all six required verbs (`Identify`, `ListMetadataFormats`, `ListSets`, `ListIdentifiers`, `ListRecords`, `GetRecord`)
- **Formats**: `oai_dc` (Dublin Core), `marc21` (MARCXML), `mods`, `mag` (MAG 2.0.1 — the ICCU national format), `unimarc`, `ric-o` (Records in Contexts Ontology, RDF/XML — archival units only)
- **Sets**: separates books, archives, and per-archival-level subsets (`fonds`, `series`, `file`, `item`) so harvesters can selectively ingest
- **Resumption tokens**: DB-backed (`oai_pmh_resumption_tokens` table) so cursor-paginated `ListRecords` calls survive across requests with a stable token
- **Selective harvesting**: `from` / `until` date filters + `deletedRecord=persistent` so harvesters get tombstones for soft-deleted rows
- **Compliance**: validated against the OAI Validator and the Europeana harvester

### 9. NCIP 2.0 Server (`ncip-server`)

**NISO Circulation Interchange Protocol** 2.0 — enables interlibrary loan exchange, self-service kiosks, and partner-ILS integration.

- **Endpoint**: `POST /ncip` (Content-Type: `application/xml`)
- **Services supported**: `LookupItem`, `LookupUser`, `CheckOutItem`, `CheckInItem`, `RenewItem`, `RequestItem`, `CancelRequestItem`
- **Authentication**: NCIP `InitiationHeader` with `FromAgencyAuthentication` shared-secret model
- **Use cases**: self-service borrowing kiosks (3M / Bibliotheca SelfCheck), library-network reciprocal lending, partner ILS bridging

### 10. BIBFRAME 2.0 Linked Data (`bibframe-linked-data`)

Exposes the book catalogue as **BIBFRAME 2.0** Linked Data per the Library of Congress transition path from MARC.

- **Content negotiation** — `Accept: application/ld+json` returns BIBFRAME JSON-LD; `Accept: text/turtle` returns Turtle
- **Stable resource URIs** — `/bibframe/works/{id}`, `/bibframe/instances/{id}`, `/bibframe/items/{id}`
- **Authority links** — When the `viaf-authority` plugin is also enabled, agents carry `owl:sameAs` to VIAF/ISNI
- **Suitable for**: Linked-Data discovery, library-of-the-future pilots, reconciliation workflows

### 11. OpenURL Resolver (`openurl-resolver`)

**Z39.88-2004 OpenURL** resolver — bridges Pinakes to bibliographic reference managers.

- **Endpoint**: `GET /openurl?rft.isbn=…` accepts standard OpenURL ContextObjects and redirects to the matching book page (or returns 404 if no match)
- **COinS metadata** — Every public book page embeds a `<span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004…">` so reference managers can capture the citation with one click
- **Compatible with**: Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, RefWorks, and any OpenURL-aware tool
- **Hardening** (v0.7.6+) — `absoluteUrl()` is used for all redirect URL construction, so host-header spoofing cannot trick the resolver into open-redirecting to an attacker-controlled domain

### 12. ResourceSync (`resource-sync`)

**ANSI/NISO Z39.99-2014 ResourceSync** — large-scale dataset synchronisation for harvester partners.

- **Endpoints**: `/.well-known/resourcesync`, `/resourcesync/capabilitylist.xml`, `/resourcesync/resourcelist.xml`, `/resourcesync/changelist.xml`
- **Use cases**: bulk-mirror Pinakes catalogue to a partner system, periodic differential sync, large-scale Linked-Data harvesting
- **Pairs with**: OAI-PMH (record-level) and SRU (query-time) for a three-layer interop stack

### 13. Music Scraper (`discogs`)

Multi-source music metadata scraping for CDs, LPs, vinyls, cassettes, and other physical music media.

- **Sources**: Discogs (barcode + title lookup), MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive (fallback by barcode), Deezer (HD jackets)
- **Catalog-number support** — Accepts Cat# identifiers (e.g. `DGG 477 8761`) in addition to barcodes ([#101](https://github.com/fabiodalez-dev/Pinakes/issues/101))
- **Rich metadata**: artist, album, label, year, tracklist with durations, genre, country of pressing
- **Bulk enrichment** — Re-scrape all music records in one click from Admin → Books → Music

### 14. MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive (`musicbrainz`)

Open-data music metadata source — no API token required.

- **Search by barcode** — Direct MBID lookup via barcode
- **Cover Art Archive** integration for HD album art
- **Tracklist, label, year, country** extraction

### 15. Deezer Music Search (`deezer`)

Lightweight music search backed by the Deezer API — no token required.

- **Search by title/artist** — Best for completing metadata when barcode lookup fails
- **HD covers** — High-resolution album artwork
- **Tracklist with durations** and genre tags

### 16. GoodLib (`goodlib`)

Adds one-click cross-search badges to the public book detail page.

- **Targets**: Anna's Archive, Z-Library, Project Gutenberg
- **Use case**: when a library wants to point patrons at legitimate open-access full-text sources alongside its own catalogue
- **Inspired by**: the GoodLib browser extension
- **Activation**: opt-in — disabled by default since not every library wants to surface third-party shadow-library links
